Following our Series B last December, I'm happy to announce we've raised a $102M Series C from existing and new investors.

Our vision of the Web is a global realtime medium for both creators and consumers, where all friction and latency are eliminated.

We'll use this investment to:

1. [Build the SDK for the Web]()
2. [Build the SDK for Web]()
3. [Lower the barrier of entry]()
4. [Focus on the end-user]()

```php


    $valor1 = 5;
    $valor2 = 3;

    $resultado = $valor1 * $valor2;

    echo "O resultado da multiplicação de $valor1 por $valor2 é:
    $resultado";
